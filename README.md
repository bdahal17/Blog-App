# SurvivingCodingBootcamp.com - A Blog

Welcome to the staff of SurvivingCodingBootcamp, a blog for former students to write about how they survived their 
coding bootcamp experience.  We have a simple blog started already, but we brought you on to make some changes.

We need you to help us add some new features and functionality to this website.

## Deadline and Grading Criteria

The deadline for this project is Monday, March 8th at 9:30am.

If the project is not complete or not pushed up to GitHub at that time it will be evaluated as an _Incomplete_ project.

This is a Pass/Fail assignment, the assignment will be considered passing if it meets the following criteria:

- Uses Git and GitHub to push complete assignment to GitHub before due date. (Not making any pushes will result in an incomplete grade.)
- The code compiles.  (No red squiggly underlines!) (Code that doesn't compile will result in a Fail)
- The provided integration tests still pass. 
- All existing request endpoints are still reachable through the browser.
- All three of the required tasks are complete.

If your project doesn't meet these criteria at the deadline, it will be marked as _Needs Improvement_.

If your project is evaluated as _Incomplete_ or _Needs Improvement_ we will let you know and give you feed back on what 
needs to change to help move it to a passing project.
You will receive a new deadline of Friday, March 12th, at 9:30 to re-submit your project by pushing changes to GitHub.  
We will evaluate your project with the same criteria as the first submission and this evaluation will be the final grade
for this assessment.
